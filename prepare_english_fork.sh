# MicMac English Fork (micmac_eng)

This is an English translation fork of the MicMac photogrammetry software originally developed by IGN (Institut GÃ©ographique National).

## About This Fork

This fork aims to make MicMac more accessible to the English-speaking community by:
- Translating French variable names, function names, and comments to English
- Maintaining full compatibility with the original MicMac functionality
- Preserving all original algorithms and processing capabilities

## Original Project

The original MicMac project can be found at:
- Official website: https://micmac.ign.fr
- Original repository: [Original MicMac Repository URL]

## Translation Status

- [x] Core source files comments translated
- [x] Build system maintained
- [ ] Full variable/function name translation (in progress)
- [ ] Documentation translation (in progress)
- [ ] XML configuration files translation (in progress)

## Building

The build process remains the same as the original MicMac:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## License

This fork maintains the same CeCILL-B license as the original MicMac project.

## Acknowledgments

All credit for the original algorithms and implementation goes to:
- Marc Pierrot Deseilligny (IGN)
- Gregoire Maillet
- Didier Boldo
- And all other MicMac contributors

## Translation Notes

This English fork was created to improve accessibility while maintaining full compatibility with the original French version. The translation process focused on:
1. Preserving all functionality
2. Maintaining build compatibility
3. Translating user-facing elements first
4. Gradual translation of internal code

For any issues or improvements, please open an issue in this repository.
